**Authors:** Amal Ibrahim Khalil, Jood Bakheet, Dhay Atiya, Raghad Al Jehani, Raja Abdullah, Miral Haddad
**Year:** 2025
**Source:** Digital Health, Volume 11: 1-22

## Key Findings

1. **Educational intervention highly effective**: Quasi-experimental study showed significant improvements in both knowledge (pre: 115.22 → post: 131.71) and attitudes (pre: 72.61 → post: 83.31) among psychiatric hospital nurses after a structured AI educational program.

2. **Baseline competence gaps identified**: Prior to intervention, 82% of nurses had NO formal training in AI for psychiatric nursing, and 66% had not attended AI workshops, despite 45% currently using AI in practice (mostly informally).

3. **Specific knowledge improvements varied**: Dramatic gains in understanding AI fundamentals (29.3% to 65% strongly agreeing "AI creates intelligent machines"), but more modest improvements in specialized areas like support groups/peer counseling applications (28% to 55.4%), suggesting need for targeted emphasis.

4. **Attitude transformation documented**: Post-intervention, 53.5% strongly agreed AI creates economic opportunities (vs 29.9% pre), 52.9% wanted to use AI in work (vs 29.3%), and concerns about AI being "dangerous" decreased from 21.7% to 45.2% strong agreement.

5. **Strong correlation between knowledge and attitudes**: Pearson correlation r=.861 (p<.001) pre-intervention and r=.777 (p<.001) post-intervention, demonstrating that knowledge improvements drive attitude changes—critical finding for intervention design.

## Methodology

**Design:** Quasi-experimental pre-post intervention study
**Sample:** 157 psychiatric nurses from Erada Complex for Mental Health and Addiction, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (purposive sampling)
**Participant Characteristics:**
- 75% under 30 years old, 87% female, 75% single
- 81% had BSc Nursing, 81% had <10 years experience
- 46% worked in female wards, 18% male wards, 20% ER
- 82% had NO AI training, 66% never attended AI workshops
- Yet 45% were USING AI in practice (knowledge-practice gap!)

**Data Collection:** February-April 2024, three validated instruments:
1. Demographic questionnaire
2. Psychiatric Nurses' Knowledge of AI Scale (30 items, 5-point Likert, developed by researchers, Cronbach's α=.887)
3. Attitude Questionnaire towards AI (20 items, 5-point Likert, Hussein et al. scale, Cronbach's α=.897)

**Intervention:** 6-week educational program, 6 sessions (4 hours each, 45-60 min per session):
- Session 1: AI fundamentals in healthcare
- Session 2: AI applications in psychiatric nursing
- Session 3: Building AI competencies
- Session 4: AI in pharmacology and genomics
- Session 5: AI-enhanced communication
- Session 6: Ethical considerations and challenges
- Mixed methods: PowerPoint, videos, group discussions, online sessions for night shift
- Booklets distributed via barcodes

**Analysis:**
- Descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, paired t-tests
- Effect sizes calculated
- Spearman correlation for demographic associations
- Significance p<.05

## Relevance to My Research

**Fits with:** [[AI-Clinical-Psychology-Ethics/lit-review-master|Literature Review]]

**Why it matters:**
- FIRST study in Saudi Arabia examining AI competence among psychiatric nurses—provides Middle Eastern/Gulf context often missing from literature
- Intervention study (not just survey)—proves educational programs CAN change both knowledge and attitudes, providing model for training design
- Documents dangerous knowledge-practice gap: 45% using AI WITHOUT formal training—exactly the ethical concern my research addresses
- Demonstrates that attitudes are malleable through education, not fixed—important for implementation strategies
- Strong correlation between knowledge and attitudes (r=.861) suggests knowledge-focused interventions are effective pathway to attitude change
- Shows even SHORT interventions (6 sessions over 6 weeks) can produce significant changes—feasibility for Turkish context

**Turkish context:**
- Saudi Arabia shares some cultural similarities with Turkey (collectivist culture, importance of professional authority, conservative healthcare systems)
- Study addresses resource-constrained setting—applicable to Turkish public mental health system
- 82% lacking formal AI training mirrors likely situation in Turkey (no systematic AI training in nursing curricula)
- Gender distribution (87% female) similar to Turkish nursing workforce
- Intervention model (6 sessions, mixed delivery) could be adapted for Turkish psychiatric hospitals
- Need identified: 46% believe AI training "essential for modern practice"—likely similar in Turkey
- Study highlights infrastructure gaps in non-Western settings

## Important Quotes

> "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in psychiatric healthcare offers transformative potential for enhancing patient outcomes, yet its success hinges on the competence and attitudes of psychiatric nurses globally." (p. 1)

> "Globally, psychiatric nurses face dual pressures: adapting to AI-driven tools like chatbots, virtual assistants, and electronic handover systems, while addressing ethical dilemmas such as data privacy, accountability, and algorithmic bias." (p. 2)

> "82% lacking this background, and 66% have not participated in AI workshops. Nevertheless, almost half of the respondents, 45%, are currently utilizing AI in their professional practice." (p. 6) [Critical finding: using AI without training]

> "The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the intervention. Participants exhibited significant knowledge improvement, with post-knowledge scores increasing from 115.22 to 131.71. Additionally, a positive shift in attitudes was observed, with post-attitude scores rising from 72.61 to 83.31." (p. 1)

> "These specific topics may require additional emphasis in future educational programs to ensure a more thorough understanding." (p. 6) [Regarding mixed gains in specific knowledge areas]

> "The intervention successfully enhanced nurses' knowledge and attitudes, emphasizing the importance of continuous professional development to ensure high-quality care for patients with addiction and mental health issues." (p. 1)

## Limitations

- Quasi-experimental design lacks randomization—cannot definitively establish causation (though strong effect sizes suggest real impact)
- Single-site study in Jeddah—limited generalizability to other Saudi regions or Middle Eastern countries
- No control group—cannot rule out external factors (e.g., concurrent media coverage of AI)
- Self-reported data susceptible to social desirability bias (participants may report more positive attitudes to please researchers)
- Short-term measurement—no follow-up to assess knowledge/attitude retention or sustained behavior change
- Convenience sampling introduces selection bias
- No measurement of ACTUAL AI use or competency—only self-reported attitudes and knowledge
- Didn't measure patient outcomes—can't confirm that improved knowledge/attitudes translate to better care

**What's missing for my research:**
- No exploration of ethical decision-making processes when using AI
- Limited examination of specific ethical dilemmas nurses face (mentions them but doesn't deeply explore)
- No data on institutional policies or regulatory frameworks
- Missing details on HOW nurses currently use AI (what tools, for what purposes, with what safeguards?)
- No comparison with other professional groups (e.g., psychiatrists, psychologists)
- Doesn't address professional regulation/credentialing for AI competence
- No analysis of cultural factors specific to Saudi/Islamic context that might affect AI adoption

## My Notes

**Critical insights:**

1. **Knowledge-practice gap is DANGEROUS**: 45% using AI without training is exactly the scenario my research warns against. This isn't hypothetical—it's happening NOW. Nurses using ChatGPT or other tools for patient care without understanding limitations, biases, or ethical risks.

2. **Education works—but specificity matters**: Overall knowledge improved significantly, but some areas (like peer support AI applications) showed more modest gains. Suggests generic "AI overview" insufficient—need targeted, context-specific training for psychiatric applications.

3. **Theoretical framework valuable**: Study integrates TAM (Technology Acceptance Model), CBE (Competency-Based Education), and Psychological Empowerment Theory. Shows perceived usefulness and ease of use mediate adoption. For Turkish context: interventions must address both technical skills AND perceived value.

4. **Correlation insight**: Strong r=.861 between knowledge and attitudes means knowledge-focused interventions effective for changing attitudes. Don't need separate "attitude change" programs—improving knowledge improves attitudes.

5. **Effect sizes substantial**: Cohen's d pre-knowledge 4.9 → post 7.0, attitudes 4.8 → 5.6. These are LARGE effects, suggesting intervention very impactful. Model worth replicating.

6. **Demographics matter variably**: Gender predicted post-knowledge (p=.039) but NOT attitudes. Prior AI experience/training strongly predicted both. Suggests: focus on experiential learning, not demographic targeting.

**For Turkish context research:**

- This intervention model (6 sessions, mixed methods, theoretical framework) could be piloted in Turkish psychiatric hospital
- Need to assess CURRENT AI use among Turkish psychiatric nurses before intervention—likely similar informal use
- Cultural adaptation needed: Saudi context more conservative than Turkey in some ways, but both share professional hierarchy, respect for authority—need to address in intervention
- Turkish Nurses Association (TBD) and psychiatric nursing specialty organizations don't have AI competency frameworks—this study provides model
- Study shows short interventions work—feasible even with limited resources

**Methodological observations:**

- Developed NEW knowledge scale (30 items) rather than use existing—good because psychiatric-specific, but limits comparability with other studies
- Effect size reporting excellent—allows meta-analysis potential
- No fidelity checks on intervention delivery—were all sessions equally effective?
- Participants divided into 5 groups over 6 weeks—potential contamination if participants discussed program between groups

**Red flags for ethics:**

- 45% using AI WITHOUT training is urgent ethical issue requiring immediate intervention
- No mention of patient consent for AI-assisted care
- No discussion of documentation requirements when AI used
- Intervention covered ethics (Session 6) but findings don't detail ethical competency gains specifically
- "Ethical uncertainty" mentioned as concern but not measured as outcome

**Comparison with other studies:**

- Higher baseline knowledge than UAE study (Abuzaid et al., 2022)—possible cultural differences or selection bias
- Effect sizes larger than Egyptian study (Hussein et al., 2022)—suggests intervention design superior or sample more receptive
- Confirms Sabra et al. (2023) finding that education improves AI literacy
- Contrasts with Castagno & Khalifa (2019) pessimism—shows attitudes CAN change with proper intervention
