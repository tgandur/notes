#lit #ai_ethics

Related: [[202512011220-AI Ethics & Mental Health Professionals]]


## Key Findings

1. **Rapid Growth**: Substantial increase in GenAI mental health studies since 2023 (ChatGPT launch)
2. **Three Domains**: Diagnosis/assessment (47%), Therapeutic tools (25%), Clinician support (30%)
3. **Ethical Concerns**: Consistently reported ACROSS ALL domains
4. **GenAI4MH Framework** proposed:
 - Data privacy & security
 - Information integrity & fairness
 - User safety
 - Ethical governance & oversight

## Methodology
**Design:** Systematic review (PRISMA 2020)
**Databases:** PubMed, ACM, Scopus, Embase, PsycInfo, Google Scholar
**Period:** Oct 1, 2019 - Sept 30, 2024
**Sample:** 79 studies (from 783 screened)

## Relevance
- Most current comprehensive GenAI review
- Ethical framework directly applicable
- Shows rapid field evolution
- Critical for understanding state-of-art

## My Notes
**GenAI4MH Framework = Actionable:**
- Can assess Turkish AI tools against these 4 dimensions
- Framework for policy/regulation development
- Training curriculum structure

**Diagnosis/Assessment Dominance:**
- Depression & suicidality detection primary uses
- Text data main input
- Limited real-world deployment despite promise

**Therapeutic Applications:**
- Chatbots, adaptive systems
- Promising outcomes but safety assurance lacking
- Gap between research and practice

**Clinician Support:**
- Clinical decision-making
- Documentation/summarization
- Therapy support, training, psychoeducation
- Most immediately implementable?

## Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (comprehensive, current, practical framework)
