# Kleine 2023 - Students & Trainees AI Tool Attitudes
#lit #ai_ethics

Related: [[202512011220-AI Ethics & Mental Health Professionals]]


## Key Findings

1. **Perceived Usefulness**: Strongest predictor for BOTH tools (feedback & treatment recommendation)
2. **Social Influence**: Significant positive effect on use intention for both tools
3. **Trust**: UNRELATED to use intentions (surprising - expected to be important)
4. **Ease of Use**: Unrelated (feedback) or NEGATIVELY related (treatment tool) - complex = capable?
5. **Cognitive Readiness**: Positive for feedback tool intention
6. **AI Anxiety**: Negative predictor for BOTH tools

## Methodology
**Design:** Cross-sectional, structural equation modeling (SEM)
**Sample:** N=206 psychology students & psychotherapists in training
**Framework:** Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)
**Tools Examined:**
- Tool 1: Feedback on motivational interviewing adherence
- Tool 2: Voice-based mood scores for treatment decisions

## Relevance: Tool-specific insights; UTAUT validation; trainee sample (future workforce)

## My Notes
- Perceived usefulness = most actionable - show clear benefits
- Social influence matters - peer/authority endorsement important
- Trust surprisingly irrelevant - maybe assumed for validated tools?
- Complexity not barrier if seen as sophisticated
- Trainees less resistant than experienced practitioners?

## Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (rigorous, theory-driven, tool-specific)
