# Peer Review Audit: AI-Clinical-Psychology-Ethics
#jots #ai_ethics

Related: [[202512011220-AI Ethics & Mental Health Professionals]]

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Reviewer:** Gemini (Agentic Audit)
**Target Document:** `drafts/literature-review-final.md`

## Executive Summary
The draft literature review presents a compelling, timely, and well-structured argument for researching AI ethics knowledge and adoption intentions among Turkish mental health professionals. The use of very recent literature (2024-2025) establishes high relevance. The logical flow from global "ethical preparedness" to the specific "Turkey gap" is persuasive. The distinction between general AI and Generative AI is present but could be sharpened in the evidence synthesis.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Distinction Between "AI" and "GenAI"
* **Severity:** Minor
* **Observation:** The introduction pivots quickly to ChatGPT (GenAI), but some cited studies (e.g., diagnostic tools) likely refer to predictive/discriminative AI.
* **Recommendation:** Explicitly clarify in the "Current Evidence" section which findings apply specifically to *Generative AI* (LLMs) versus broader *Clinical AI* (diagnostic algorithms), as the ethical risks (hallucination vs. bias) differ slightly.

### 2. "Shadow IT" elaboration
* **Severity:** Minor / Opportunity
* **Observation:** The section on "Shadow IT" (Gölge Bilişim) is a strong point.
* **Recommendation:** If possible, strengthen the connection to the Turkish context. Are there examples of WhatsApp usage for patient data in Turkey? Connecting "Shadow IT" to prevalent "Shadow Communication" habits in Turkey would make this argument locally resonant.

### 3. Citation Verification (2025 Dates)
* **Severity:** Note
* **Observation:** The review heavily relies on 2025 citations (Cecil, Wang, Khalil, Boyacı & Söyük). Given the current date (Jan 2026), these are "last year's" papers, which is excellent for currency.
* **Recommendation:** Ensure these citations are finalized published versions and not pre-prints, given the very recent dates.

## Turkish Context Check
* **Status:** **Adequate / Strong**
* **Notes:**
 * The integration of KVKK is appropriate.
 * Citing local studies (Boyacı & Söyük, 2025; Elgin & Elgin, 2024) grounds the review well.
 * **Gap identified:** The mention of "limited cross-cultural adaptability" and "collectivist values" is good but abstract.
 * **Suggestion:** Could expanding on *specific* Turkish cultural norms (e.g., "mahremiyet" understanding vs. Western "privacy") add depth?

## Proposed Next Steps
1. **Refine "Shadow IT" argument:** Add a sentence linking it to local informal communication habits (e.g., WhatsApp).
2. **Methodology Definition:** The Research Questions are clear. The next logical step is to define the *measurement tools* for "Ethical Knowledge" and "Intention" adapted for Turkish.
3. **ReviewGenAI Specifics:** Ensure the "Ethical Preparedness" scale/questions cover GenAI specifics (hallucination awareness) and not just general algorithmic bias.
