## Methodology
**Design:** Systematic review
**Databases:** PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus
**Period:** 2014-2024 (10 years)
**Sample:** 51 articles
**Analysis:** Comprehensive synthesis of ethical considerations

## Relevance
- Most comprehensive ethical framework
- Actionable categories (use, develop, practice)
- 10-year span = longitudinal perspective
- Practical roadmap for responsible AI

## My Notes
**Comprehensive Roadmap:**
- 18 considerations organized into actionable categories
- Covers full lifecycle: development → implementation → use → evaluation
- Can be checklist for Turkish AI initiatives

**Privacy & Confidentiality:**
- Consistently #1 concern across studies
- Mental health data especially sensitive
- Turkish context: collectivist culture, family involvement - how does privacy work?

**Informed Consent:**
- Must be meaningful, not just legalistic
- Patients must understand what AI is, what data used, how decisions made
- Challenge: explaining complex AI to vulnerable populations

**Bias & Fairness:**
- Training data may not represent Turkish population
- Western-developed AI tools may embed cultural biases
- Need Turkish-specific validation

**Transparency & Accountability:**
- Who decides when AI used?
- Who liable if AI wrong?
- Clear governance structures needed

**Autonomy & Human Agency:**
- AI must support, not replace, human decision-making
- Patient choice paramount
- Turkish context: balance individual autonomy with family involvement

**Stakeholder Engagement:**
- MHPs, patients, developers, policymakers all must participate
- Co-design critical for culturally appropriate AI
- Turkish stakeholder engagement process?

**Continuous Evaluation:**
- Not one-time implementation
- Ongoing monitoring of outcomes, ethics, safety
- Feedback loops essential

**Turkish Implementation:**
- Use 18 considerations as assessment framework
- Identify which considerations most relevant to Turkish context
- Develop Turkish-specific ethical guidelines based on this framework
- Ensure regulatory alignment
