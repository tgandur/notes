# Yıldız 2025 - AI in Mental Health Nursing (TURKEY!)
#lit #ai-ethics

Related: [[202512011220-AI Ethics & Mental Health Professionals]]


## Key Findings

1. **Central Tension**: AI offers efficiency gains but risks eroding empathy and therapeutic relationship - core of mental health nursing

2. **Complementary, Not Substitutive**: AI should SUPPORT, not REPLACE human interaction; excessive reliance risks reducing patients to "data points"

3. **New Synthesis Proposed**: Mental health nurses as "cyborg" practitioners - AI handles data-intensive tasks, freeing nurses for genuine human interaction

4. **Ethical Framework**: Applies personalist ethics (Rendtorff 2002) - four principles: Autonomy, Dignity, Integrity, Vulnerability

5. **Key Risks Identified**:
 - Lack of empathy in AI systems
 - Over-reliance weakens professional observation/reasoning skills
 - Algorithmic bias and discrimination
 - Data privacy concerns
 - Accountability gaps ("black box" decisions)
 - Patients feeling like "mere data points"

6. **Key Benefits Identified**:
 - Early warning/diagnosis support
 - Personalized care plans
 - Administrative burden reduction
 - Pattern detection humans miss
 - Efficiency in routine tasks

7. **Recommendations**:
 - Restructure nursing education to include AI competencies
 - Create robust feedback channels
 - Establish comprehensive ethical principles
 - Ensure transparency and accountability
 - Preserve human dimension as PRIMARY, AI as SECONDARY

## Methodology

**Design:** Debate essay / Theoretical analysis

**Approach:**
- Review of contemporary literature
- Application of multiple theoretical lenses:
 - Personalist ethics (Rendtorff 2002)
 - "Cyborg ontology" (Lapum et al. 2012)
 - Technology acceptance models
 - Patient-centered care principles
- Integration of field observations
- Critical analysis of benefits vs risks

**Method:** NOT empirical - theoretical/conceptual paper examining tension between efficiency and human touch

**Geographic Context:** Turkey (Inonu University, Malatya)

## Relevance to My Research

**Why it matters:**
**CRITICAL - ONLY TURKISH PAPER IN COLLECTION!** Provides Turkish academic perspective on AI in mental health care. Written by Turkish scholar at Turkish institution. Represents Turkish nursing perspective. Demonstrates Turkish engagement with AI ethics discourse. Shows how Turkish scholars frame the efficiency-empathy tension. Essential baseline for Turkish context research.

**Turkish context:**
- **Direct Turkish voice** on AI in mental health
- From Inonu University, Malatya (Eastern Turkey)
- Reflects Turkish nursing education perspective
- Demonstrates Turkish scholars engaging with global AI ethics debates
- Shows adoption of Western theoretical frameworks (personalist ethics) in Turkish context
- Highlights Turkish values: emphasis on therapeutic relationship, empathy, human dignity
- Nursing-focused (important as nurses are frontline in Turkish mental health system)
- Calls for curriculum reform - directly applicable to Turkish nursing programs
- Ethical framework resonates with Turkish cultural values (dignity, vulnerability, compassion)

## Important Quotes

> "AI should be implemented to enhance, not replace, human interaction in mental health nursing. A new synthesis is proposed where AI systems support efficiency, thereby allowing nurses more time to address patients' complex emotional needs." (Abstract)

> "Excessive reliance on algorithms risks damaging the patient-nurse relationship, potentially reducing individuals to data points." (Abstract)

> "Empathy and emotional bonding, which form the basis of the nurse–patient relationship, cannot be substituted by algorithmic systems. Moreover, overuse of technology may lead patients to perceive themselves as mere 'data points.'" (p. 3)

> "The template responses given by an algorithmic chat system to a suicidal patient can be both incomplete and hurt emotional sensitivities. As a result, the patient may feel lonely and the treatment process may be interrupted." (p. 4)

> "If human warmth is replaced by machines, patients may perceive themselves as mere numerical data and may not be able to establish a real connection during the treatment process. This may lead individuals who are already mentally fragile to isolate themselves from the treatment and feel a sense of worthlessness." (p. 4)

> "Mental health nurses are, perhaps inevitably, evolving. They are increasingly becoming 'cyborgs'—a blend of human compassion and technological capability." (p. 2)

> "Instead of replacing nurses, AI should be considered as a tool that supports their clinical decisions and enriches the therapeutic relationship by alleviating repetitive workload." (p. 3)

## My Notes

### Professional Attitudes - Turkish Nursing Perspective

**Turkish Nursing Values (Implicit):**
- STRONG emphasis on therapeutic relationship, empathy, human connection
- Holistic care approach (biopsychosocial)
- Trust and compassion as core values
- Resistance to dehumanization/mechanization
- Professional identity tied to human caring, not technical tasks

**"Cyborg Nurse" Concept:**
- Not rejecting technology, but redefining role
- Blend of compassion + capability
- AI does data work, nurse does human work
- Reimagining, not abandoning, nursing

**Concerns Expressed:**
- Over-dependence weakens professional skills
- Algorithmic outputs can't replace clinical reasoning
- Technology might distance nurses from patients
- Efficiency gains not worth losing empathy

### Ethical Concerns - Personalist Framework

**Four Principles Applied:**

1. **Autonomy**
 - Patients' right to informed decisions
 - AI must support, not override, patient self-determination
 - Informed consent for AI use

2. **Dignity**
 - Inherent worth of every individual
 - Risk: AI reduces persons to data points
 - Human dignity non-negotiable even for efficiency

3. **Integrity**
 - Wholeness of person
 - Holistic care requires seeing full person, not just symptoms
 - AI pattern recognition misses individual stories

4. **Vulnerability**
 - Mental health patients especially vulnerable
 - Extra protection needed
 - AI errors/bias particularly harmful for fragile individuals

**Other Ethical Issues:**
- **Privacy**: How is data processed? Who has access?
- **Accountability**: "Black box" AI - unclear responsibility chain
- **Bias**: Training data may not represent diverse populations
- **Discrimination**: Risk deepening health inequalities
- **Transparency**: Need clear explanation of AI decisions
- **Safety**: Regular audits, security measures essential

### Barriers to Adoption - Turkish Context (Implied)

**Cultural/Professional Barriers:**
- Strong emphasis on human relationship in Turkish culture
- Nursing identity rooted in caring, not technical efficiency
- Resistance to mechanization of care
- Fear of losing professional autonomy

**Knowledge/Skills Barriers:**
- Current nursing education doesn't include AI competencies
- Need for curriculum restructuring
- Lack of feedback channels between educators, practitioners, tech developers

**Ethical/Trust Barriers:**
- Concerns about patient trust if AI involved
- Worry about accountability gaps
- Fear of algorithmic bias
- Privacy concerns in close-knit Turkish society?

**System Barriers (Not Explicitly Discussed):**
- Turkish healthcare system readiness?
- Resources for AI implementation?
- Regulatory framework?
- Infrastructure?

### Training Needs - Explicit Recommendations

**Nursing Education Restructuring:**
- Fundamental revision of curricula needed
- Equip nurses with AI competencies
- Teach ethical use of AI
- Balance technical skills with preservation of human caring
- Integration of AI ethics into nursing ethics courses

**Content Needed:**
- Understanding AI capabilities and limitations
- Critical evaluation of algorithmic outputs
- Maintaining clinical reasoning skills while using AI support
- Ethical decision-making with AI
- Patient communication about AI use
- When to trust vs question AI recommendations

**Competencies:**
- AI literacy
- Data interpretation
- Ethical reasoning
- Maintaining empathy while using technology
- Integrating AI into therapeutic relationship without damaging it

### Cultural Factors - Turkish Context

**Personalist Ethics Fits Turkish Values:**
- Emphasis on human dignity resonates with Turkish/Islamic values
- Vulnerability principle aligns with Turkish cultural compassion
- Autonomy balanced with family/community (collectivist culture)
- Integrity/wholeness aligns with holistic Turkish healthcare approach

**Turkish Nursing Culture:**
- Relationship-centered
- Family involvement in care
- Respect for authority (doctors, but also nurses as professionals)
- Emotional expression valued
- Trust built through personal connection

**How AI Might Challenge Turkish Values:**
- Collectivist decision-making vs individual data/autonomy
- Family involvement - how does AI account for this?
- Emotional expressiveness - can AI recognize culturally-specific expressions?
- Islamic bioethics - compassion, mercy, beneficence - how does AI align?

**Opportunities in Turkish Context:**
- Efficiency gains could reduce overburdened nurses' stress
- More time for human interaction if AI handles admin work
- Early detection could improve care in under-resourced areas
- Telemedicine/AI combo could reach rural Turkey

### "New Synthesis" Concept - Practical Implications

**What It Means:**
- Not just "add AI to current practice"
- Fundamental reimagining of care delivery model
- AI as infrastructure, humans as interface
- Technology liberates nurses for deeper human work

**How to Achieve:**
- Clear role delineation: AI for data, humans for emotion
- Workflow redesign: AI handles routine, predictable tasks
- Time reallocation: less admin, more therapeutic time
- Skill development: nurses become expert AI users + expert humans
- Feedback loops: nurses inform AI development based on patient needs

**Risks of "New Synthesis":**
- Could still lead to over-reliance
- Might create two-tier nursing (tech-savvy vs not)
- Could increase rather than decrease workload if poorly implemented
- May fail if AI doesn't actually reduce burden (implementation gap)

### Comparison to Other Papers

**Contrasts:**
- Cecil 2025: Empirical, quantitative → Yıldız: Theoretical, qualitative reasoning
- Blease 2024: Psychiatrists → Yıldız: Nurses
- Sharif 2025: Saudi data → Yıldız: Turkish perspective (but no data)
- Empirical papers: what MHPs think → Yıldız: what scholars argue they should think

**Similarities:**
- All emphasize training needs
- All identify efficiency vs empathy tension
- All call for ethical frameworks
- All see AI as complement not replacement
- All concerned about patient impact

**Unique Contribution:**
- Only Turkish voice
- Only explicitly applies personalist ethics framework
- Only proposes "cyborg nurse" synthesis concept
- Only nursing-specific theoretical analysis
- Only from non-Western country (though uses Western theories)

### Research Implications for Turkish Study

**What Yıldız Shows Exists in Turkey:**
- Academic engagement with AI ethics
- Awareness of global debates
- Adoption of Western theoretical frameworks
- Nursing scholarship on technology

**What Yıldız Reveals is MISSING in Turkey:**
- **Empirical data on Turkish MHP attitudes** (he didn't collect any!)
- Turkish-specific cultural analysis (uses universal framework)
- Assessment of current AI use in Turkish settings
- Turkish patients' perspectives
- Turkish healthcare system analysis

**Research Questions Yıldız Raises:**
- Do Turkish nurses actually share Yıldız's concerns?
- How do Turkish psychiatric nurses vs psychologists vs psychiatrists view AI?
- What is actual AI use in Turkish mental health settings?
- How do Turkish cultural values (collectivism, Islamic ethics) affect AI attitudes?
- Is "cyborg nurse" concept acceptable to Turkish nurses?
- What specific barriers exist in Turkish context?
- How prepared are Turkish nursing programs to teach AI competencies?

**My Research Should:**
- Provide the empirical data Yıldız doesn't have
- Test his theoretical claims with Turkish MHPs
- Explore cultural factors he doesn't address
- Examine system-level barriers he overlooks
- Compare Turkish findings to Western studies
- Investigate whether personalist ethics framework resonates with Turkish MHPs or if different framework needed

## Connections

- [[Sharif 2025 - Saudi MH Professionals AI Perceptions]] - Both Middle Eastern, Muslim-majority contexts
- [[Cecil 2025 - MH Practitioners AI Perceptions]] - Turkish nurses' attitudes could parallel Germany/US findings
- [[Blease 2024 - Psychiatrists Experiences GenAI]] - Contrast nursing vs psychiatry perspectives
- [[Khalil 2025 - AI Competence Psychiatric Nurses]] - Both focus on nursing, training needs
- All empirical papers: Provide data to test/challenge Yıldız's theoretical claims
- Personalist ethics could be applied to Turkish context more explicitly
- "Cyborg" concept could inform survey design (acceptance of hybrid role?)
