# Are General Public Attitudes Towards Using AI for Mental Health Positive?
#lit #ai_attitudes

Related: [[202601301240-AI User Attitudes]]


**Document Type:** Consensus.app AI-powered synthesis of 20 papers (from 1,005 identified)

**Summary Answer:** Yes, general public attitudes towards using AI for mental health are **mixed but increasingly positive**, especially among digitally literate groups in Turkey and some non-Western contexts, though **anxiety, lack of knowledge, and cultural factors** still present significant barriers.

---

## Key Findings

### General Attitudes
- **82.7% of nurses** in Turkey report positive attitudes toward AI in health/mental health (low-to-moderate anxiety)
- **Healthcare professionals and students** show predominantly positive attitudes
- **General public attitudes** are more variable but trend positive with higher digital literacy
- Positive attitudes associated with perceived benefits: efficiency, well-being, life satisfaction

### Predictors of Positive Attitudes
- **Digital literacy:** Higher computer use and AI knowledge predict positive attitudes
- **Personality traits:** Openness, conscientiousness, extraversion linked to favorable views
- **Lower AI anxiety:** Reduced anxiety correlates with acceptance
- **Education:** Targeted interventions can transform negative attitudes

### Barriers to Acceptance
- **Privacy concerns** remain persistent
- **Job security fears** (displacement anxiety)
- **Ethical use concerns** about AI in mental health
- **Lack of knowledge** about AI capabilities/limitations
- **Cultural and religious factors** (underexplored but influential)

## Methodology

### Search Strategy
- **Databases:** 170M+ papers (Consensus, Semantic Scholar, PubMed)
- **Search focus:** Public attitudes toward AI in mental health, Turkey, non-Western contexts
- **Selection:** 1,005 identified → 341 screened → 93 eligible → **20 included**
- **8 unique search groups**, 21 targeted searches

### Populations Covered
- Healthcare professionals (well-studied)
- Nursing students (moderate coverage)
- General public (minimal coverage) ⚠️
- Rural populations (GAP) ⚠️
- Culturally diverse groups (GAP) ⚠️

### Key Papers Cited

2. **Kaya et al. (2022)** - Personality traits & AI anxiety, Int'l Journal of Human-Computer Interaction
3. **Tarsuslu et al. (2024)** - Digital leadership & AI anxiety in nurses, Journal of Nursing Scholarship

## Relevance to This Project

### Critical Research Gap Identified
**"Most studies focus on healthcare professionals or students, with limited research on the general public in Turkey and other non-Western countries."**

This **directly validates** the rationale for our research project:
- Turkish research overwhelmingly targets **MH professionals**, not **general public**
- Gap in understanding **urban vs. rural** differences
- **Cultural/religious factors** systematically underexplored
- Lack of **longitudinal studies** tracking attitude change over time

### Implications for Survey Design

#### Domains to Measure (from literature)
1. **Willingness to use** AI for mental health support
2. **Trust** in AI vs. human therapists
3. **Privacy concerns** (persistent barrier)
4. **Knowledge** about AI capabilities/limitations
5. **AI anxiety** levels
6. **Digital literacy** (strong predictor)
7. **Demographics** + mental health literacy

#### Validated Instruments Available
- **AIAS-4** (Artificial Intelligence Attitude Scale) - Turkish adaptation by Satıcı et al. (2025)
- **NGAAIS** (Nursing Students' General Attitudes Towards AI Scale) - Turan & Cengiz (2025)
- Could adapt items for general public sample

#### Sample Considerations
- Target both **urban and rural** populations (gap in literature)
- Include **digital literacy assessment** (key moderator)
- Stratify by **age, education, socioeconomic status**
- Consider **cultural/religious factors** in item wording

## My Notes

### Synthesis Quality
This Consensus document is **excellent** as a starting point for literature review. It:
- Identifies 20 high-quality papers systematically
- Provides clear evidence strength ratings (strong/moderate/weak)
- Highlights research gaps explicitly
- Offers structured "open research questions" that align with our goals

### Next Steps Based on This Review
1. **Obtain full texts** of the 5 key Turkish papers cited (Satıcı, Kaya, Tarsuslu, Turan & Cengiz)
2. **Review AIAS-4 instrument** for potential adaptation to general public
3. **Expand search** beyond healthcare professionals to general population studies
4. **Examine cultural factors** literature more deeply (identified as weak/gap)
5. **Look for international comparisons** to contextualize Turkish findings

### Policy Implications (from synthesis)
- **Knowledge deficiency:** If Turkish public is willing to use AI despite lack of training/regulation, there's a gap
- **Education needed:** Targeted digital literacy interventions can improve attitudes
- **Transparency required:** Concerns about privacy/ethics persist; need clear communication
- **Equitable access:** Rural and less digitally connected populations underserved

### Questions Raised
- How do **Turkish cultural values** (collectivism, family orientation, religiosity) shape AI acceptance?
- What specific **privacy concerns** are most salient in Turkish context (vs. Western samples)?
- Are there **urban-rural divides** in AI literacy and willingness to use?
- Would Turks prefer **AI-augmented** human therapists vs. fully autonomous AI?

## Research Gaps Matrix (from Document)

| Population | Attitude Measurement | Digital Literacy Impact | AI Anxiety/Barriers | Cultural/Religious Factors |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Healthcare Professionals | 4 studies | 2 studies | 3 studies | 1 study |
| Students | 3 studies | 2 studies | 2 studies | GAP |
| **General Public** | **1 study** | **GAP** | **GAP** | **GAP** |
| Rural Populations | GAP | GAP | GAP | GAP |
| Culturally Diverse Groups | GAP | GAP | GAP | GAP |

**Our project addresses the highlighted gaps.**

## Open Research Questions (Recommended by Consensus)

1. **How do general public attitudes toward AI in mental health differ across urban and rural populations in Turkey?**
 - *Why:* Urban-rural differences may reveal unique barriers/opportunities for AI adoption

2. **What is the impact of cultural and religious beliefs on acceptance of AI for mental health in non-Western societies?**
 - *Why:* Cultural/religious factors may significantly shape attitudes and should inform intervention design

3. **Can targeted digital literacy interventions improve public attitudes and reduce AI anxiety in underrepresented groups?**
 - *Why:* Interventions could address key barriers and promote equitable access to AI-supported mental health care
