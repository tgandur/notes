Related: [[202512011220-AI Ethics & Mental Health Professionals]]


## Key Findings

1. **High Awareness, Low Use**: 85.7% aware of AI but only 24.3% used AI in practice - major awareness-to-action gap

2. **Positive but Unprepared**: Participants positively rated AI's impact (mean 3.48-3.75 out of 5) but felt unprepared for role-specific AI implementation (mean 2.78)

3. **Profession Differences**: Nurses had significantly higher AI impact perceptions than other professionals (p<0.0001)

4. **Awareness Matters**: Those aware of AI had higher perceptions of AI's impact (p<0.0001) and those with AI awareness showed different preparedness levels (p=0.029)

5. **Specialty Effects**: Specialty (profession type) significantly affected AI preparedness perceptions (p=0.001)

6. **Demographics**: Sample predominantly female (56.6%), aged 31-40 (50%), married (45%), and nurses (55.4%)

## Methodology

**Design:** Cross-sectional online survey

**Sample:** N = 251 mental health professionals from two governmental mental health hospitals in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
- 55.4% nurses
- 56.6% female
- 50% aged 31-40 years
- 45% married

**Data Collection:**
- Online survey via two governmental mental health hospitals
- Shinners Artificial Intelligence Perception (SHAIP) questionnaire
- Two sections: (1) Sociodemographic questions, (2) SHAIP assessing perceptions toward AI in mental healthcare
- Data analyzed using IBM SPSS

**Measures:**
- AI awareness (yes/no)
- AI use in practice (yes/no)
- AI impact perceptions (SHAIP subscale)
- AI preparedness perceptions (SHAIP subscale)
- Demographic variables (age, gender, marital status, profession/specialty)

## Relevance to My Research

**Why it matters:**
FIRST study exploring MHP perceptions of AI in Saudi Arabia - a Middle Eastern, predominantly Muslim, resource-rich but culturally distinct context. Provides critical non-Western perspective on AI attitudes. Shows universal patterns (awareness-use gap, preparedness concerns) but also unique cultural context for implementation.

**Turkish context:**
- **Critical comparison point**: Both Middle Eastern countries with predominantly Muslim populations, but different healthcare systems, economic contexts, and technology adoption patterns
- Saudi Arabia more resource-rich, Turkey more developed civil society
- Similar cultural values around human relationships, trust in healthcare, family involvement
- Both face challenges of training deficits, awareness-use gaps
- Saudi findings on nurses vs physicians may parallel Turkish context
- Both countries modernizing healthcare with AI but need culturally-appropriate implementation
- Turkish study can build on Saudi methodology (SHAIP questionnaire?)

## Important Quotes

> "Only 24.3% used AI in practice, though 85.7% were aware of AI" (Abstract)

> "Participants positively rated AI's impact (mean item range: 3.48-3.75) and felt unprepared for role-speciﬁc AI (mean 2.78)" (Abstract)

> "The study provides insights into mental health professionals' views on AI in mental healthcare, emphasizing the need for targeted education to improve AI literacy and preparedness among Saudi healthcare professionals" (Abstract)

> "While AI use in Saudi Arabia is progressive, there is minimal exploration of its role and impact within mental health services" (Background)

## Limitations

**Study limitations:**
- Single geographic location (Jeddah only)
- Governmental hospitals only (excludes private sector)
- Cross-sectional (no causation, no change over time)
- Convenience sample from two hospitals
- SHAIP questionnaire validation in Saudi context unclear
- No qualitative depth to understand reasons behind perceptions
- Limited exploration of cultural factors

**What's missing for my research:**
- No exploration of cultural/religious factors affecting attitudes
- No comparison across Saudi regions
- No examination of barriers specific to Middle Eastern context
- Missing: training content preferences, specific ethical concerns in Saudi/Islamic context
- No patient perspectives
- Limited detail on which AI applications participants were aware of
- No longitudinal data on attitude changes

## My Notes

### Professional Attitudes - Saudi Context

**Nurses vs Other Professionals:**
- Nurses had significantly HIGHER AI impact perceptions
- Possible reasons: More exposure to health tech? Different role expectations? Less threat to professional identity?
- Contrast with Western studies where psychiatrists often more positive
- May reflect different professional hierarchies, scopes of practice in Saudi context

**High Awareness, Low Use Paradox:**
- 85.7% aware but only 24.3% use = 61.4 percentage point gap!
- Larger than most Western studies
- Suggests barriers beyond awareness: access, training, institutional support, cultural factors?

**Positive but Unprepared:**
- See benefits (mean 3.48-3.75) but don't feel ready (mean 2.78)
- Classic implementation gap
- Need for targeted education emphasized

### Ethical Concerns

- Study doesn't deeply explore ethical concerns
- Preparedness likely includes ethical preparedness
- Islamic bioethics context: importance of human dignity, privacy, compassion
- Need to examine how Islamic principles interface with AI ethics

### Barriers to Adoption

**Identified:**
- Low preparedness for role-specific AI
- Training/education gaps
- Awareness-to-practice conversion barriers

**Implied but not explored:**
- Cultural barriers?
- Institutional barriers (governmental hospitals may have different constraints)
- Regulatory/policy barriers in Saudi context
- Language barriers (most AI tools in English)
- Trust in technology vs human judgment
- Religious/cultural compatibility concerns

### Training Needs

**General Need Established:**
- "Need for targeted education to improve AI literacy and preparedness"
- Specialty-specific training needed (significant specialty effects)
- Role-specific training (preparedness varies by role)

**Content Not Specified:**
- What specifically do Saudi MHPs need to learn?
- How to culturally adapt AI training?
- Islamic bioethics integration?

### Cultural Factors - UNDER-EXPLORED

**Saudi-Specific Context:**
- Predominantly Muslim population - how do religious values affect AI attitudes?
- Gender-segregated healthcare in some settings - implications for AI use?
- Family involvement in care decisions - how does AI fit?
- High-resource context but rapid modernization - adoption readiness?
- Government-driven healthcare modernization - top-down vs bottom-up?

**What Study SHOULD Have Explored:**
- Religious/cultural values affecting AI acceptance
- Trust in technology vs human providers (cultural dimension)
- Privacy concerns in collectivist vs individualist society
- Family decision-making vs individual autonomy
- Arabic language AI tools availability and acceptability
- Cultural appropriateness of AI interactions (empathy, respect norms)

**Comparison to Turkish Context:**
- Both Muslim-majority but Turkey more secular governance
- Both Middle Eastern but different geopolitical positions
- Both modernizing healthcare but different economic models
- Saudi: resource-rich, government-led; Turkey: middle-income, mixed public-private
- Cultural similarities: family-centered care, respect for authority, relationship emphasis
- How would Turkish MHPs compare to Saudi on awareness, use, preparedness?

### Methodological Notes

**Strengths:**
- Uses validated SHAIP questionnaire
- Adequate sample size (N=251)
- Statistical rigor (SPSS, significance testing)
- Governmental hospitals = standardized context
- First Saudi study on this topic

**Weaknesses:**
- No qualitative depth
- Limited to Jeddah (not representative of all Saudi Arabia)
- No cultural variables measured
- Cross-sectional snapshot only
- Convenience sampling

### Profession-Specific Findings

**Nurses (55.4% of sample):**
- Higher AI impact perceptions
- May be more receptive to AI integration
- Different professional concerns than physicians/psychologists?
- Nursing role more task-oriented, less existential threat from AI?

**Specialty Effects on Preparedness:**
- Significant differences (p=0.001)
- But study doesn't detail which specialties more/less prepared
- Need breakdown: psychiatric nurses vs psychiatrists vs psychologists vs social workers

### Implications for Turkish Research

**What to replicate:**
- Use of validated tool (SHAIP or similar)
- Examining awareness vs use gap
- Impact perceptions vs preparedness perceptions
- Profession/specialty comparisons

**What to add:**
- Cultural variables (collectivism, religiosity, trust in authority)
- Qualitative component to understand "why"
- Multiple cities/regions
- Private vs public sector comparison
- Specific barriers and facilitators
- Training content preferences
- Ethical concerns specific to Turkish/Muslim context

**Research Questions for Turkey:**
- Will Turkish MHPs show similar awareness-use gap?
- Will nurses be more positive like in Saudi study?
- How do cultural factors (secularism vs religiosity) affect attitudes?
- What culturally-specific barriers exist in Turkey?
- How does Turkey compare to Saudi and Western countries?
