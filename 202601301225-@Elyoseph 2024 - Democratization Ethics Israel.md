#lit #ai_ethics

Related: [[202512011220-AI Ethics & Mental Health Professionals]]


## Key Findings

1. **New Phase**: GenAI represents unprecedented democratization of mental health knowledge & practice
2. **Benefits**: Accessibility, personalized responses, conceptual flexibility, flattening hierarchies
3. **Risks**: Significant ethical challenges requiring careful deliberation
4. **Strategic Questionnaire**: Tool for assessing AI mental health applications (benefits vs risks)
5. **Call to Action**: Cautious yet positive approach; MHPs must actively engage in guiding GenAI development

## Methodology
**Type:** Theoretical/ethical analysis
**Approach:** Historical context → current capabilities → ethical deliberation → assessment tool
**Framework:** Democratization of information lens

## Relevance
- Democratization angle unique
- Israeli perspective (non-Western but developed)
- Assessment tool practical
- Emphasizes MHP agency in shaping AI

## My Notes
**Democratization Concept:**
- From restricted → open access (internet, open-source, now GenAI)
- GenAI = qualitative leap: access to ADVANCED TECH not just information
- Mental health = delicate domain, requires nuanced ethical deliberation

**Power Dynamics:**
- Traditional hierarchy: expert (provider) → lay person (patient)
- GenAI enables: flattening of hierarchies
- Patients can access knowledge previously gatekept
- Empowerment or risk?

**Strategic Questionnaire:**
- Benefits assessment: accessibility, personalization, flexibility
- Risks assessment: accuracy, privacy, dependency, regulation
- Balanced approach: neither techno-optimism nor technophobia

**MHP Engagement:**
- MUST be involved in development, not just users
- Shape tools to be ethically sound, patient-centered
- Ensure alignment with professional values

**Turkish Context:**
- Democratization may threaten traditional authority structures (collectivist culture)
- But also increase access in under-served areas
- How do Turkish MHPs view hierarchy-flattening?

## Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (unique angle, practical tool, call for MHP agency)
