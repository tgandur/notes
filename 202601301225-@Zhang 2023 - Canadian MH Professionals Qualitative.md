## Key Findings

1. **Four Major Themes**:
 - Fostering practice change & building self-efficacy to integrate AI into patient care
 - Promoting system-level change to accelerate AI adoption
 - Addressing organizational readiness as catalyst for adoption
 - Ensuring MHPs have education, knowledge, skills to harness AI

2. **Persistent Gap**: Despite AI potential for efficient, reliable, higher-quality care, persistent gap in adoption among MHPs

3. **Client Access**: AI tools increasingly accessed by clients/service users - MHPs MUST be prepared to discuss

4. **Needs Assessment**: Study identifies learning needs and informs development of AI education curricula & knowledge translation products

## Methodology

**Design:** Qualitative descriptive approach

**Sample:** N = 20 mental health professionals (Ontario, Canada)
- Maximum variation sampling: psychiatrists, MH nurses, educators, scientists, social workers
- Various settings: urban/rural, public/private, clinical/research
- Breakdown: 45% social workers, 5% MH nurses, 25% educator-scientists (dual roles), 15% practitioner-scientists (dual roles)

**Data Collection:** Semi-structured interviews exploring AI adoption needs

## Relevance to My Research

**Why it matters:**
ONLY qualitative study in collection providing depth on "why" behind attitudes. Multi-disciplinary sample captures diverse perspectives. Identifies system and organizational barriers beyond individual attitudes. Canadian context provides North American comparison.

**Turkish context:**
- System/organizational barriers likely even more salient in Turkish healthcare system
- Training/education needs universal
- Client access to AI tools = global phenomenon, relevant to Turkey
- Multi-disciplinary approach models what Turkish study should include

## My Notes

**Four Themes Deep Dive:**

1. **Practice Change/Self-Efficacy**: Individual-level psychological readiness - confidence in ability to use AI effectively
2. **System-Level Change**: Healthcare system structures, policies, incentives must support AI
3. **Organizational Readiness**: Institutions need infrastructure, culture, support for AI implementation
4. **Education/Knowledge/Skills**: Foundation - can't use what you don't understand

**Multi-Level Barriers Model:**
- Individual: self-efficacy, knowledge, attitudes
- Organizational: readiness, culture, resources
- System: policies, regulations, incentives

**Turkish Implications:**
- Turkish healthcare system readiness?
- Organizational capacity in Turkish hospitals/clinics?
- Need multi-level intervention, not just individual training
- Policy/regulatory environment critical
