# Wagner 2025 - German Psychotherapists AI Attitudes
#lit #ai_ethics

Related: [[202512011220-AI Ethics & Mental Health Professionals]]


## Key Findings

1. **Technical Divide**: 40% self-identified as "not technically inclined" - substantial knowledge gap affecting attitudes

2. **Predictors of Positive Attitudes**:
 - Perceived usefulness in conducting diagnoses (significant)
 - Perceived usefulness in creating personalized treatment plans (significant)
 - Empathic support (rated lower for enhancing therapy but still significant predictor across all groups)

3. **Technology Affinity Differences**:
 - Technically affine therapists: Associated AI benefits with diagnostics
 - Non-affine therapists: Emphasized empathic support and relapse prediction
 - Different professional values/concerns based on tech comfort

4. **Fears and Concerns**:
 - Professional replacement fears widespread
 - Limited understanding of AI/ML technologies
 - Concerns about AI's role in empathic/human aspects of therapy

5. **Education as Solution**: Critical factor for addressing fears, uncertainties, and knowledge gaps

## Methodology

**Design:** Cross-sectional survey

**Sample:** N = 181 licensed psychotherapists in Germany
- Recruited via German Psychotherapeutical Association's online directory
- Mix of technically affine and non-affine therapists

**Data Collection:**
- Survey assessing:
 - Attitudes toward AI/ML
 - Technical affinity
 - Perceptions of AI utility across psychotherapeutic tasks
- Hierarchical regression analyses to identify predictors of AI acceptance

## Relevance to My Research

**Why it matters:**
Focuses specifically on psychotherapists (not psychiatrists or nurses) - critical professional group in mental health care. Identifies technology affinity as key moderating variable affecting attitudes. Shows how professional background (technical vs non-technical) shapes AI perceptions. Important for understanding heterogeneity within MHP population.

**Turkish context:**
- Turkish psychotherapists likely similarly divided on technical affinity
- Fear of replacement may resonate in Turkish context where therapy relationships highly valued
- Education gap similarly critical in Turkey
- Can compare German vs Turkish psychotherapist attitudes
- Technical divide suggests need for differentiated training approaches in Turkey

## Important Quotes

> "40% of the sample self-identified as not technically inclined, suggesting a knowledge gap in AI/ML that might influence attitudes"

> "Negative attitudes toward AI/ML application are discussed in a frame of fears of professional replacement and limited understanding of AI/ML technologies"

> "Education could emerge as a critical factor in addressing fears and uncertainties surrounding AI/ML"

> "Emphasizing the irreplaceable human qualities of psychotherapists may also alleviate fears of obsolescence"

## My Notes

**Professional Attitudes:**
- Technically affine vs non-affine creates two distinct attitude profiles
- Both see value but in different applications
- Professional identity threat more salient for some than others
- Need to address replacement fears explicitly

**Training Needs:**
- 40% technology knowledge gap = massive educational challenge
- Different training needed for technically affine vs non-affine
- Must emphasize human-AI complementarity not competition
- Reassurance about irreplaceable human qualities important

**Barriers:**
- Knowledge/understanding deficits
- Professional identity threats
- Technology anxiety/discomfort
- Limited exposure to AI/ML concepts

**Turkish Implications:**
- Likely similar technical divide exists
- May be larger in Turkey given less tech integration in training historically
- Turkish psychotherapists may have even stronger emphasis on human relationship
- Need culturally-appropriate messaging about AI as complement

## Connections
- [[Cecil 2025 - MH Practitioners AI Perceptions]] - Both find affinity for technology predicts adoption
- [[Kleine 2023 - Attitudes toward adoption]] - Similar sample (trainees)
- [[Yıldız 2025 - AI Mental Health Nursing Turkey]] - Similar emphasis on preserving human connection
