4. Hub Notes: Like MOCs but can be about a subject 
5. Peeople Notes: Like Mocs for people collected via baclinks plugin. 
6. Rules: 
    - use links sparingly even notes that not yet created (I will add timestamp if I create, that way it easy to spot not yet created notes, but archive does not update links so name şould be the same)We can use a plugin to get a broken links list so you can check them from now and then
    - There can be multiple ref notes about the same source they will be linked.
